# Excel Dashboard Practice Project

##  About the Project
This project is an **exercise** I worked on while following YouTube tutorials to learn data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, and dashboard creation in Excel.  

The goal was to practice transforming raw data into meaningful insights and presenting them in a clear, interactive dashboard.

##  Process & Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Created a separate sheet to preserve the **original dataset** (so no changes affect the raw data).
   - Cleaned the dataset by:
     - Renaming some columns to be more understandable.
     - Creating **age brackets** from the raw age column using Excel functions (to make charts easier to interpret).

2. **Pivot Tables**
   - Explored different relationships in the dataset, such as:
     - **Income by Gender** â†’ compared average income levels between male and female respondents.
     - **Bike Purchased by Commute Distance** â†’ analyzed whether people with shorter or longer commutes were more likely to purchase a bike.
     - **Bike Purchased by Age Group** â†’ showed how bike purchases varied across age brackets.
   - These pivot tables were then used to build charts for the dashboard.

3. **Dashboard**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard from the pivot tables.
   - Added **charts** to visualize key insights.
   - Used **slicers** to allow filtering by categories (e.g., marital status, region, education), making the dashboard dynamic and easy to explore.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome
This project helped me practice the **end-to-end workflow** of:
- Preserving raw data  
- Cleaning and preparing data  
- Summarizing with pivot tables  
- Designing an interactive dashboard with slicers  

Itâ€™s a learning exercise, but it shows how Excel can turn data into insights.
